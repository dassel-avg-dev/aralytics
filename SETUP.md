# SETUP.md — Aralytics Setup & Developer Guide

> Quick-start instructions, default demo credentials for Student & Teacher views, and available workspace commands.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: `v20.x` or later (`v22.x` recommended)
- **npm**: `v10.x` or later
- **Git**: `v2.40+`

---

## 2. Quick Start

```powershell
# 1. Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# 2. Start the Vite development server (http://localhost:3000)
npm run dev
```

Or run commands directly from the repository root (`aralytics/`) using `--prefix frontend`:

```powershell
npm --prefix frontend install
npm --prefix frontend run dev
```

## 3. Default Credentials (Student & Teacher)

### Login Screen (`/login`)

The `/login` screen pre-fills default demo credentials automatically when switching between the **Student** and **Teacher / Educator** tabs:

| Role | Identifier (Email / ID) | Alternate ID | Default Password | Redirects To |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Student** | `miguel@school.edu.ph` | `s2024-9102` | `student123` | `/student/dashboard` |
| **Teacher / Educator** | `maria.santos@university.edu.ph` | `t2024-0104` | `teacher123` | `/teacher/dashboard` |

> **Demo Mode Behavior**: In frontend standalone mode (prior to backend auth integration), clicking **Sign In to Aralytics** with the pre-filled (or any non-empty) credentials simulates authentication (`900ms` spinner → `600ms` verified badge) and navigates directly to `/student/dashboard` or `/teacher/dashboard` based on the active role tab.

---

### Account Activation & Registration (`/register`)

When testing the institutional onboarding flow on `/register`:

| Role | School / Institution Code | Issued Access Key / PIN | Password Requirement | Redirects To |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Student Activation** | `STJUDE-MNL-2025` (or `STJUDE-CS-2025`) | `KEY-8821-PY` | 8+ chars, ≥1 number, matching confirm (e.g. `Student123!`) | `/student/dashboard` |
| **Teacher / School Setup** | `STJUDE-MNL-2025` (or `STJUDE-CS-2025`) | `FAC-2025-DEPED` | 8+ chars, ≥1 number, matching confirm (e.g. `Teacher123!`) | `/teacher/dashboard` |

---

## 4. Available Commands

Run inside `frontend/` (or from root with `npm --prefix frontend run <script>`):

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Starts Vite dev server with HMR at `http://localhost:3000` |
| `npm run build` | Builds production bundle into `frontend/dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | Serves the production build locally for verification |
| `npm run lint` | Runs `oxlint` across `frontend/src/` (must exit with 0 warnings and 0 errors) |
| `npm run fetch-screens` | Runs `node ../fetch-screens.mjs --out ../screens/stitch` to pull Stitch HTML/PNG exports |
